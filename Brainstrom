/*Inital Solutions/Ideas for Requirement
    Front-End:
       -Have a table where the rows are the recipes.
            *each row would consists of name, description, and table
            
             *When the recipe is clicked on then a table expands(maybe open new page; check if I can use angular components/download angular components to computer)

        -A form for the name, description, steps, ingredents(reference the book ticket case where i tlet you add multiple customer but now for steps & ingredients)

        -Radio button on form for difficult.
    
    Back-End:
       Recipe Object = {
         name: string,
         description: string,
         ingredients: [],
         steps: [],
         difficult: string, (would store an value from an difficultly array or a enum
    }

   Have an object for indivual recipes(above) then have an array of recipes that would consists of recipe objects.

/* 4/11 - 4/17 TO-DO
   1. Add Form Validation
      * Difficultly must be selected 4.11
      * Name must be provided
      * Description must be provided
      * Ingredients length must be greater than 1
      * Step ingredients must be greater than 1
   2. Make it so you add ingredients to array when enter is pressed look at Ch 7(I think) as referecne
   3. Repeat That for the Step Incredient
   4. Using QueryString pass back the to recipe_blog.js and set a recipe object
