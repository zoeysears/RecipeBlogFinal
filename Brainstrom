/*Inital Solutions/Ideas for Requirement
    Front-End:
       -Have a table where the rows are the recipes.
            *each row would consists of name, description, and table
            
             *When the recipe is clicked on then a table expands(maybe open new page; check if I can use angular components/download angular components to computer)

        -A form for the name, description, steps, ingredents(reference the book ticket case where i tlet you add multiple customer but now for steps & ingredients)

        -Radio button on form for difficult.
    
    Back-End:
       Recipe Object = {
         name: string,
         description: string,
         ingredients: [],
         steps: [],
         difficult: string, (would store an value from an difficultly array or a enum
    }

   Have an object for indivual recipes(above) then have an array of recipes that would consists of recipe objects.
