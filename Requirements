//Requirements for project to reference in the future

/* Specific Project Requirements

• In this project, you will have to design a simple blog for posting recipes with comment
    functionality.

• Allow user to:
    • Enter a name, a description

    • Add a detailed blog-type post to accompany the recipe

    • Add a list of ingredients for the recipe (should be entered separately and stored in an
        array)

    • Add individual steps for the recipe (separate entry for each step, should be stored in an
        array)

    • Add some ranking for difficulty

• A page should display all recipes in a summary listing format

• Each recipe should be clickable to display the detailed recipe blog post

• Each recipe blog post should be an object containing the details above plus the arrays
    for steps and ingredients.

• The blog should allow the user to create as many recipes as they would like, maintaining
    and displaying all previous recipe entries.

• The user should be able to start a new recipe post after completing a previous post.

• The user should be able to view previously entered recipes at any time.

• An object should be used to store each recipe. An array should be used to manage all
    recipe objects.

• The system should then store data in a browser-based database or storage mechanism.
    This may involve cookies, sessionStorage, localStorage, or other browser-based
    mechanisms.

• Conditional statements should be used to validate entries in the recipe entry form to
    ensure data is entered correctly

• A loop should be used to display the array information (steps and ingredients). 

*/

/* General Requirements
• HTML elements
    o <html> html>
    o <head> </head>
    o <title> </title>
    o <body> </body>

• JavaScript elements
    o Some method to dynamically write html
    o Conditional statement (if, case, etc)
    o Specifying 1 or more event handlers
    o Exception handling: try, catch, finally
    o Use of an object
    o Use of an array of objects
    o Some kind of data storage mechanism to maintain information required at least
        until the browser session closes.
    o A loop (for or while) must be implemented meaningfully in the
        project. Generally, you should be able to use a loop (or multiple loops) to handle
        the data stored in the array of objects.
